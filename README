Introduction
============

cpuinfo prints information about the CPU of the host
it is running on. On x86_64 it uses the cpuid instruction
to gather information. There is no real support for
ppc_64 (e.g., the Cell PPE) currently.


Requirements
============

A C99 compatible compiler is necessary for compilation.
The code compiles on Linux and Mac Os X.


Installation
============

This guide assumes that you start out in the cpuinfo directory
and that the bin directory of cmake is in your $PATH.
To install cpuinfo, you should create a new directory for
building

% mkdir build
% cd build

You can simply type

% cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PREFIX> ..

where <PREFIX> is the directory where you want to install
the headers and library file.
To build and install cpuinfo you can type

% make
% make install


Known Problems
==============

No known bugs so far.
